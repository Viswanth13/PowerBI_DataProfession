# Data Profession Survey

This dashboard shows the stats of responses of various people in a survey conducted. All the survey takers are involved in the data profession.

The file type of the dataset is 'xlsx'.

I have performed data cleaning in the PowerBI tool before starting the dashboard.
I have added a new column 'Average Salary' from the 'Current Yearly Salary' column, removed unnecessary columns in the file, and simplified the responses for columns like Role, Country of origin, Favorite programming language, etc.

In the dashboard, I have performed the following visualizations:

- Average Salary in USD for the job title.
- Favorite programming language
- Country of the survey takers
- Level of ease for people to crack into the data profession
- Number of survey takers
- Average age of survey takers
- Satisfaction of survey takers with Work/Life Balance
- Satisfaction of survey takers with Salary
